Absolutely, that's an excellent idea! Creating a pool of fallback questions would be very doable and would significantly improve the user experience. Here's how you could implement it:

1. **Create a Question Bank**:
   Create an array of pre-defined GRC questions that follow the same structure as the current fallback question.

2. **Implement Random Selection**:
   When a parsing error occurs, randomly select a question from your fallback pool instead of using the cached question.

3. **Track Recently Used Questions**:
   Keep track of recently used fallback questions to avoid repeating them too soon.

Here's a simple implementation you could add to your GRC service:

```javascript
// Array of fallback questions - you can expand this with many more
const fallbackQuestions = [
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes the concept of defense in depth?",
    // ... rest of question 1
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary purpose of a security policy?",
    // ... rest of question 2
  },
  // Add many more questions here
];

// Track recently used fallbacks
let recentlyUsedFallbacks = [];
const MAX_TRACKING = 10; // Only track the 10 most recent to avoid duplicates

function getRandomFallbackQuestion() {
  // Filter out recently used questions if possible
  let availableQuestions = fallbackQuestions.filter(
    q => !recentlyUsedFallbacks.includes(q.question)
  );
  
  // If we've filtered out all questions, reset and use the full pool
  if (availableQuestions.length === 0) {
    availableQuestions = fallbackQuestions;
    recentlyUsedFallbacks = [];
  }
  
  // Select a random question from available ones
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableQuestions.length);
  const selectedQuestion = availableQuestions[randomIndex];
  
  // Track this question to avoid repeating soon
  recentlyUsedFallbacks.push(selectedQuestion.question);
  
  // Keep the tracking list at a reasonable size
  if (recentlyUsedFallbacks.length > MAX_TRACKING) {
    recentlyUsedFallbacks.shift(); // Remove oldest
  }
  
  return selectedQuestion;
}
```

Then replace the current fallback mechanism with this:

```javascript
// When there's a parsing error:
return getRandomFallbackQuestion();
```

You could even categorize the fallbacks by difficulty and topic, and select one that matches the user's requested category/difficulty when possible. This approach would provide a seamless experience where users always get a seemingly "new" question, even when there are parsing errors behind the scenes.

The more questions you add to your fallback pool, the more varied the experience will be!
